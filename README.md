The Initial main Branch upload consisted of a test with ChatGPT. Having not the hardware and OS desired to Prototype
Embedding Characters in the Silicon Components, ChatGPT was able to emulate the materials for Prototyping - countering the lack of budget
as well the current optimal production necessity being on the road at the time of this report.

The DART Edge AI Low-level Language is designed for custom Hardware Embedding.
With this in place The language will assume machine code or bytecode runs from wall power across the CPU
and GPU using electron states for switching gates but here where the former 0 and 1
are no longer accounted for as mathematical
order of operations and radical order of operations.
Instead the Language will assume there is circuit, chip, memory and any other hardware
are processing the standard binary electrical current where each of the radical side of the 12 order of operations,
being the last 6 operations half of the twelve, are each composed of materials that all the binary electrical pulse to trigger
each of the six physics gate entirely pure pulse or binary state. This method will account for one instruction having multiple
processing paths from one binary pulse. Each physic hardware unit can apply the same pulse as it's own physics
independently or as a desired group and whole. The capability is due to the assumption the material which makes each physic
unit has the neutrons aligned as that physic and each alignment of the 6 physics will have one additional alignment in common, the square.

In the brief the advanced future form of this manufacturing process
will allow the user to narrow inquiries or programming statements to nothing more
than mere checks and checkboxes of 2 variations as well as anything else explicitly desired for receiving a result.

Milestones:-:

Milestone 1: The final rule draft by spring of 2024.

Milestone 2: A working DARTEdge AI IDE geared towards Apple Hardware With the option for emulating using Cpp. Summer 2024.

Milestone 3: Opensource and Custom Hardware with DARTEdge AI for protyping after builds. Winter 2024.
